    <h1>Current Version: 1.0.0</h1>

    <h2>Repository addon</h2>

    <p>Note: You'll have to update the repository.  We now use ResolveURL.<p>

    <p>Instructions for adding this repo:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Kodi file manager.</li>
      <li>Click on "Add source"</li>
      <li>The path for the source is <b>https://azndoodle.github.io/kodi-repo/repo</b>  Give it the name "dumpster-repo".</li>
      <li>Go to "Addons"</li>
      <li>In Addons, install an addon from zip.  When it asks for the location, select "dumpster-repo", and install
          <a href="https://azndoodle.github.io/kodi-repo/repo/repository.dumpster-1.0.0.zip">repository.dumpster-1.0.0.zip</a>
      </li>
      <li>Go back to Addons install, but this time, select "Install from repository"</li>
      <li>Select the "dumpster-repo"</li>
      <li>Go into the "Video add-ons" section in the repo, and you'll find the Icdrama plugin.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For those of you updating, remember that you need to force a <a href="https://koditips.com/force-check-for-updates-kodi-addons/">check for updates</a>
    in order to get Kodi to bring in the ResolveURL depencency.</p>

    <p>Also, if latest version doesn't show up, FORCE the repo to update by refreshing the repo.  This will force to read the latest 
      addons.xml (assuming the addons.xml.md5 has a new checksum.</p>


    <h2>ResolveURL</h2>

    <p>Icdrama now uses the ResolveURL resolver.  Installing from the repo
       above should bring in the latest ResolveURL.<p>

    <h2>Manually downloading the zip files</h2>

    <p>You can manually download the zip files from 
       <a
           href="https://azndoodle.github.io/kodi_repo/zips/plugin.video.icdrama/">plugin.video.icdrama</a>,
       but if you do this, you won't automatically bring in the ResolveURL
       dependency.</p>
